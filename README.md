Developed a dynamic web application using JavaScript and The application offers both current weather conditions and future forecasts for user-specified cities or their current location. Key features and contributions include:

1.INTERACTIVE UI ELEMENTS: Implemented user-friendly features like input fields for city selection, keyboard event handling for user convenience, and interactive dropdowns for detailed weather insights.
2.API INTEGRATION: Utilized the Fetch API to make asynchronous requests to the OpenWeatherMap API, fetching accurate and up-to-date weather data. Handled API responses and parsed JSON data to extract relevant information.
3.WEATHER IMAGE MAPPING: Created an image mapping system that correlates weather descriptions with appropriate weather icon images. The application visually represents weather conditions to users.
4.DATA DISPLAY: Designed the interface to display essential weather information, including city name, country, temperature, description, and a dynamic background image reflecting the current weather conditions.
5.FORECAST VISUALIZATION: Constructed a forecast section displaying the next 5 days' weather details, including time, icons, and temperatures. Employed arrays to store and update this data dynamically.
6.GEOLOCATION INTEGRATION: Integrated the Geolocation API to provide weather information based on the user's current location. Users can instantly access local weather forecasts for their convenience.
7.DROPDOWN FUNCTIONALITY: Created a dropdown system that expands on user interaction to reveal more in-depth weather details for selected days. This feature enhances user engagement and data exploration.
8.DOM MANIPULATION: Implemented DOM manipulation techniques to dynamically create and update elements on the webpage. This enabled seamless rendering of weather data and an intuitive user interface.
9.ERROR HANDLING: Implemented error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage scenarios where the entered city is not found, ensuring a smooth user experience.
